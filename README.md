CPU-Utilization
===============

The script is especially modified for the *SAP HANA indexserver*.
If you are interested in monitoring the utilization of other Unix/Linux process, simply modify the starting part
of the script such that it could receive the *PID* as the param.

The original Unix/Linux command, I mean *top* and *ps*, are quite limited in the function of monitoring the utilization of multiple CPU cores. This accounts for the existence of the script. :)
